        A computer is a machine that uses electronics to input, process, and then output data. Input of data means to read information from a keyboard, a storage device like a hard drive, or a sensor. The computer processes or changes the data by following the instructions in software programs.
         <p>The first computers were used primarily for numerical calculations. However, as any information can be numerically encoded, people soon realized that computers are capable of general-purpose information processing. Their capacity to handle large amounts of data has extended the range and accuracy of weather forecasting.<p> Their speed has allowed them to make decisions about routing telephone connections through a network and to control mechanical systems such as automobiles, nuclear reactors, and robotic surgical tools.</p><p>They are also cheap enough to be embedded in everyday appliances and to make clothes dryers and rice cookers “smart.”</p><p>Computers have allowed us to pose and answer questions that could not be pursued before. </p><p>These questions might be about DNA sequences in genes, patterns of activity in a consumer market, or all the uses of a word in texts that have been stored in a database.</p><p> Increasingly, computers can also learn and adapt as they operate.</p>

    <p><h3><em>Computer languages</em></h3></p>
    
       
        
       <p> A computer language is a method of communication with a computer. Types of computer languages include:</p>
       <ul>
        
       <li> Construction language, all forms of communication by which a human can specify an executable problem solution to a computer</li>
       <li> Command language, a language used to control the tasks of the computer itself, such as starting other programs</li>
        <li>Configuration language, a language used to write configuration files</li>
        <li> Programming language, a formal language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer</li>
            <li>Markup language, a grammar for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, such as HTML</li>
                <li>Modeling language, a formal language used to express information or knowledge, often for use in computer system design</li>
                    <li>  Hardware description language, used to model integrated circuits</li>
                        <li> Page description language, describes the appearance of a printed page in a higher level than an actual output bitmap</li>
                            <li>  Query language, a language used to make queries in databases and information systems</li>
                                <li> Simulation language, a language used to describe simulations</li>
                                    <li> Specification language, a language used to describe what a system should do</li>
                                        <li>Style sheet language, a computer language that expresses the presentation of structured documents, such as CSS</li>
                                            <li> Transformation language, designed to transform some input text in a certain formal language into a modified output text that meets some specific goal</li>
       </ul>
